Flickr Urls can be a little hard to create sometimes, which farms, which server, etc.  Why should you do another API call for that info?  You dont have to.  If you know the photo_id... that is enough. (more coming)

==Example:==

http://flickrimg.appspot.com/i/*photo_id*.jpg  will redirect to the proper url. 

http://flickrimg.appspot.com/i/3956299042.jpg goes to http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2627/3956299042_f252e72ff0.jpg



Also you can pass what size you	want too.  http://flickrimg.appspot.com/i/*photo_id*.*size*.jpg	 

Where size can be t, s, m, b, or l  see flickr for the sizes: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html



Example: http://flickrimg.appspot.com/i/3956299042.l.jpg


The service is running and avaiable on GAE here: http://flickrimg.appspot.com
